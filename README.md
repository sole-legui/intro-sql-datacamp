Introduction to SQL

</p><b>Selecting columns</b>
This chapter has provided me  a brief introduction to working with relational databases.
I learnt about their structure, how to talk about them using database lingo, and how to begin an analysis using simple SQL commands to select and summarize columns from database tables.

</p><b>Filtering rows</b>
In this chapter I learnt how to filter tables for rows satisfying some criteria of interest as well as how to use basic comparison operators, combine multiple criteria, match patterns in text.
So far commands: WHERE AND , WHERE AND OR.
